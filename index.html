Privacy Policy — Tensor
Effective date: [2026/1/4]

Tensor (“the App”) helps you scan barcodes or search product names to find a best-available price match from public web listings. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect and how we use it.

Information we collect

We do not require an account and we do not collect your name, email, phone number, or precise location by default.

The App may process:
	•	Search text you type (e.g., “airpods”).
	•	Barcode value (UPC/EAN) scanned with your camera.
	•	Network metadata required for normal internet operation (e.g., IP address) may be processed by our hosting provider when the App calls our API, but we do not use it to identify you.

How we use information

We use search text and barcode values only to perform price lookups and return results to you.

Camera access

If you choose “Scan,” the App requests camera permission to scan UPC/EAN barcodes. The App does not record or store video; the camera is used only for live scanning.

Data sharing

We may share the minimum information needed to provide results:
	•	Our API hosting provider (e.g., Cloudflare Workers) processes requests so the App can fetch results.
	•	Third-party merchants/websites: if you tap a purchase link, you are taken to the merchant site and their privacy policy applies.

We do not sell your personal information.

Data retention

We do not intentionally store your searches or scanned barcodes on our servers. Temporary logs (if any) may be retained by infrastructure providers for security and reliability.

Analytics / tracking

We do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs in the App at this time.
(If you add analytics later, update this section.)

Children

The App is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Changes

We may update this policy. The “Effective date” will be updated when changes are posted.
