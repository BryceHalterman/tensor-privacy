    <h1>Privacy Policy for Tensor</h1>

    <p class="small">Effective date: <strong>January 2026</strong></p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>
            Tensor (“we”, “us”, or “the App”) provides a barcode scanning and product search tool to find
            price matches from publicly available web listings.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Tensor does <strong>not</strong> require an account and does not collect personal data such as
            names, email addresses, or payment information by default.</p>
        <p>We may process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search text you enter.</li>
            <li>Barcode (UPC/EAN) scanned via your camera.</li>
            <li>Basic network metadata necessary for API requests (e.g., IP address) processed by our hosting
                provider.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Use of Information</h2>
        <p>Information is used only to perform price lookup and return results to you. We do not store
        personal information with the intent to identify individuals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Camera Access</h2>
        <p>Tensors requests camera access only to enable barcode scanning. The live camera feed is used
        only to detect barcodes and is <strong>not</strong> recorded or stored.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
        <p>If you tap a “Buy” link, you are redirected to the respective merchant site. That site’s
        privacy policy then applies.</p>
        <p>We use our hosting provider’s infrastructure to serve API data, which may process requests
        in accordance with its own infrastructure policies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Tensor does not intentionally retain search or barcode data. Temporary logs may be retained
        by infrastructure providers for security and reliability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Analytics</h2>
        <p>Tensor does <strong>not</strong> include third-party analytics or tracking SDKs at this time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>This App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information
        from children.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>Support: <a href="mailto:support@yourdomain.com">support@yourdomain.com</a></p>
